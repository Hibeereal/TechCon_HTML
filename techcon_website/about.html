        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <P>TechCon began as a small community meetup in 2017, organized by a group of passionate software engineers and tech enthusiasts who wanted to bridge the gap between innovation and collaboration across Africa. What started as a modest event with 50 attendees quickly grew in reputation for its practical workshops, engaging keynote speakers, and its strong focus on future-forward technologies.

      By 2020, TechCon had expanded into a full-scale annual technology conference attracting developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and students from across the continent. Each year, it has tackled pressing themes — from open-source collaboration and digital inclusion to AI, cloud computing, and ethical innovation.

      TechCon 2024 marks the 7th edition of the conference, with its biggest attendance yet and a strong emphasis on web development, cybersecurity, AI integration, and the power of community-driven tech solutions. This year, the event celebrates the creators, learners, and thinkers who are shaping Africa’s digital future.

      Whether you’re a seasoned engineer or just starting out, TechCon 2024 offers a platform to learn, connect, and grow.
